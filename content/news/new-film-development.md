We're thrilled to announce that Deadset Pictures has begun development on a new feature film project. The script, written by an acclaimed screenwriter, explores themes of identity and belonging in a modern Australian context.

Pre-production is expected to begin in late 2024, with filming scheduled for early 2025. The project has already attracted interest from several funding bodies and potential distribution partners.

"This is exactly the kind of story we've been wanting to tell," says our creative director. "It combines compelling characters with a narrative that speaks to contemporary audiences while maintaining our commitment to authentic Australian storytelling."

More details about the cast, crew, and production timeline will be announced in the coming months. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting new project!
