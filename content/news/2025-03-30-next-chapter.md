**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**ANNOUNCING THE NEXT CHAPTER OF DEADSET PICTURES**

Veteran television executive Dan Bennett and award-winning journalist and filmmaker Steve Pennells are proud to unveil the new evolution of their creative partnership: a revitalised and reimagined Deadset Pictures.

With a sharp focus on developing bold, original IP for global audiences, Deadset Pictures is now helmed by the powerhouse duo. Together, they bring decades of experience across television, film, factual and scripted content, with credits and accolades spanning Australia’s most high-profile television networks.
Dan Bennett, one of the most experienced drama executives in the country, has been the creative force behind more than 1,500 hours of primetime television. With credits including Home and Away, Winners & Losers, Molly, The Informant, and Tripping Over, his passion for character-led storytelling and industry acumen brings deep creative leadership to the company.

Steve Pennells, a five-time Walkley Award-winning journalist and recipient of the prestigious Gold Walkley, has spent two decades telling urgent, human-centred stories from the frontlines of war zones, political upheaval and social injustice. A former investigative reporter with Seven Network's Sunday Night and founder of Deadset Pictures, his work has shaped national conversations across print, TV, and documentary.

Together, their complementary strengths promise to deliver projects that illuminate, challenge, entertain, and push beyond the margins of mainstream storytelling. With a slate that spans drama, comedy, documentary, and feature film, Deadset Pictures is positioned to become a key player in the international screen landscape.
The team currently has multiple projects in active development, including a prestige drama series, a daring factual hybrid, and an internationally-focused limited series — all designed to resonate with audiences around the world.

Deadset Pictures is committed to stories that matter. Stories that break convention. Stories that travel.
