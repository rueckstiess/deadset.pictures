Deadset Pictures is delighted to announce the expansion of our creative team with three new talented professionals joining us this month. As our project slate continues to grow, these strategic additions will strengthen our production capabilities and bring fresh perspectives to our creative process.

## Meet Our New Team Members

### Sarah Thompson - Senior Producer

Sarah joins us with over 15 years of experience in film and television production. Her impressive portfolio includes work on award-winning documentaries and narrative features. Sarah will oversee our expanding slate of projects, with a particular focus on our documentary initiatives.

"I'm thrilled to join the Deadset team," Sarah shared. "Their commitment to authentic storytelling aligns perfectly with my own production philosophy, and I'm excited about the diverse projects we'll be developing together."

### Michael Chen - Director of Photography

Michael brings his distinctive visual style and technical expertise to our team after establishing himself as one of Australia's most innovative cinematographers. His work has been featured at numerous international film festivals, and his approach to visual storytelling will be an invaluable asset to our upcoming productions.

### Emily Rodriguez - Post-Production Supervisor

Emily's extensive experience in post-production workflows and her expertise in the latest editing and visual effects technologies will enhance our in-house post-production capabilities. Her appointment allows us to handle more complex post-production requirements internally, ensuring creative continuity throughout the production process.

"These appointments represent our commitment to growth and excellence," said Steve Jacobs, Co-founder. "Each of these talented individuals brings unique skills and perspectives that will help us continue to create compelling and innovative content."

The new team members have already begun work on several upcoming projects, including our recently announced feature film and the StreamNow streaming series currently in development.
