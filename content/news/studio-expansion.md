## New Equipment

Our technical upgrades include:

- RED Komodo 6K camera systems
- Comprehensive DJI Ronin ecosystem for stabilized movement
- Enhanced lighting package featuring ARRI and Aputure fixtures
- Professional audio recording equipment

## Expanded Post-Production

We've also completely redesigned our post-production workflow with:

- Two new professional editing suites

- Dedicated audio mixing room
- Collaborative workflow integration

This expansion represents a major step forward in our capabilities, allowing us to handle more complex productions while maintaining complete creative control throughout the entire filmmaking process.

"This investment reflects our commitment to growth and excellence," said our technical director. "These enhancements will not only improve our current production quality but also allow us to take on more ambitious projects in the future."

The expanded facilities are now fully operational and already being utilized for our upcoming projects.
