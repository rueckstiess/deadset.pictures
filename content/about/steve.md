Steve Pennells is one of Australia’s most awarded and respected journalists. A five-time Walkley Award winner and recipient of the Gold Walkley, he has spent over two decades reporting from war zones, political flashpoints and the frontlines of social injustice — always with a focus on urgent, human-driven storytelling.

His work has shaped national conversations across print, television and documentary.

Steve has won the UN Media Peace Prize a record six times and received the Clarion Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism.

He was named by MediaWeek magazine as one of the top 25 people currently working in the Australian media and in 2018, he became the youngest living inductee into the Australian Media Hall of Fame where he was hailed as "one of Australia’s most influential journalists of the past two decades across print, television, photo and video journalism."
