At Deadset Pictures, we create bold, world-class screen content driven by fearless storytelling and a proudly Australian perspective. From scripted drama to documentary, limited series to feature films, factual hybrids to dark comedy — we develop stories with the power to move audiences everywhere.

Our team brings together deep industry experience across every corner of the production landscape — from journalism and screenwriting to showrunning, casting, and creative development. With a shared track record spanning some of the country’s most recognisable television and film, we’re uniquely positioned to tell stories that are culturally grounded yet globally ambitious.

We are committed to unearthing new voices and elevating perspectives that have long been underserved — both on screen and behind the camera. Diversity, inclusion, and authenticity aren’t just values we aspire to — they’re embedded in how we develop, cast, and crew every project.

With a slate that champions fresh ideas, emotional resonance, and distinctive vision, Deadset Pictures is fast becoming a home for storytellers who dare to say something different — and for audiences who expect more from what they watch.
